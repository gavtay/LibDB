# LibDB

This project is a relational database built in MySQL. It is a library database that contains 4 tables, establishes conditions and relationships, and a file with multiple sample queries to run on the database. 

This project was built in MySQL with the current most up to date version, and is recommended for all users (At this current date is version 8.0.32). 

Download the LibDBTables.sql file first, which is located in the "Tables" folder, this contains the scripts to create all required tables along with their constraints. Proceeding this step, download and run the LibDBKeyIndex.sql file located in the "Tables" folder as well. This contains the various keys to relate the tables in the database, as well as indexes to improve search time. After running both of these scripts, the database will be set up and ready to be queried. If wished, the sample queries in the Problems folder can be used (this file is called LibQueries.sql, located in the "Problems" folder), or you can run your own queries if so desired.
